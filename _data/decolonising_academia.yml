The aim of the project was to increase the understanding of the steps, which can be taken to decolonise education in a way that will have a beneficial impact on the quality of teaching through the creation of a more inclusive and representative education system.

- title: Against Decolonisation, Taking African Agency Seriously
  author: Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò
  description: Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò fiercely rejects the indiscriminate application of ‘decolonisation’ to everything from literature, language and philosophy to sociology, psychology and medicine. He argues that the decolonisation industry, obsessed with exposing slights and cataloguing wrongs, is seriously harming scholarship on and in Africa. He finds decolonisation as applied to culture intellectually unsound and wholly unrealistic, conflating modernity with coloniality, and groundlessly advocating an open-ended undoing of global society’s foundations. Worst of all, today’s movement attacks its own proclaimed cause. ‘Decolonisers’ themselves are disregarding, infantilising and imposing values on contemporary African thinkers.
