# Welcome!

Hello, my name is Samira!

I am a SeNSS funded 1+3 PhD Candidate in the Department of Government at the University of Essex. I research post-revolutionary violence, decolonisation, ethnic representation, public opinion and democratisation in Sub-Saharan Africa. 

Before I began the PhD, I founded and worked on the Essex Decolonise the Curriculum campaign. This campaign started with a survey I designed to understand students' academic experience at the University of Essex. The need for this survey emerged from discrepancies in student satisfaction and representation in the curriculum and overall learning experience.

Through this campaign and the work of the Tackling Racism Group of which I was a part, the university has now allocated a suite of resources to support this project and the advancement of BAME scholars in higher education. Whilst working on this theme, I assisted Dr Hannah Gibson and Dr Colin Reilly on "Decolonising the Curriculum \| The Work", a project funded by the Global Challenge Research Fund. This project was a continuation of the initial campaign at Essex, and through this I was involved in organising a series of focus groups and webinars on decolonising the curriculum.
