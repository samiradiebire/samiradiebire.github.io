# Welcome!

I am a 1+3 PhD Candidate in the Department of Government at the University of Essex, and I am currently finishing my MSc in Conflict Resolution. 

I research post-revolutionary violence, decolonisation, ethnic representation, public opinion and democratisation in Sub-Saharan Africa. My thesis looks into the role of expectations in shaping political violence in a post-revolutionary context. Using survey data after Burkina Fasoâ€™s latest uprising in 2014, I argue that post-revolutionary political discontent can lead to the increase and diffusion of violence. My doctoral research is funded by the South East Network for Social Sciences (SeNSS).
