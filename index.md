My research interests lie in post-revolutionary politics, political violence, ethnic representation, foreing policy, public opinion and democratisation in Sub-Saharan Africa. My thesis explores the role of expectations in shaping political violence in a post-revolutionary context. Using survey data collected after Burkina Fasoâ€™s latest uprising in 2014, I argue that post-revolutionary political discontent can lead to the increase and diffusion of violence. My doctoral research is funded by the South East Network for Social Sciences (SeNSS).
